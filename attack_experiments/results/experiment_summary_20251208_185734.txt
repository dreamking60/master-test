======================================================================
Experiment Date: 2025-12-08 18:57:34
Experiment ID: trajectory_20251208_185734

======================================================================
EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
======================================================================
Normal Controller:
  - Pattern: Continuous forward
  - Frequency: 10 Hz
  - Duration: 60 seconds
  - Expected Behavior: Robot moves straight forward

Attack:
  - Type: Turn left
  - Frequency: 50 Hz (5x normal frequency)
  - Start Delay: 5 seconds
  - Duration: 15 seconds
  - Angular Speed: 0.5 rad/s

======================================================================
EXPERIMENT RESULTS
======================================================================

BEFORE ATTACK (0-5 seconds):
  - Duration: 5.00 seconds
  - Start Position: (0.000, 0.000)
  - End Position: (0.559, 0.000)
  - Distance Traveled: 0.559 m
  - Average Linear Velocity: 0.169 m/s
  - Average Angular Velocity: 0.000 rad/s
  - Yaw Change: 0.0° (straight line)
  - ✅ Normal operation: Robot moving straight forward

DURING ATTACK (5-20 seconds):
  - Duration: 15.00 seconds
  - Start Position: (0.607, 0.000)
  - End Position: (0.717, 0.004)
  - Distance Traveled: 0.122 m
  - Average Linear Velocity: 0.013 m/s (decreased)
  - Average Angular Velocity: 0.422 rad/s (increased!)
  - Yaw Change: -130.3° (significant left turn!)
  - ✅ Attack successful: Robot turned left significantly

AFTER ATTACK (20-65 seconds):
  - Duration: 44.98 seconds
  - Distance Traveled: 6.766 m
  - Average Linear Velocity: 0.173 m/s
  - Average Angular Velocity: 0.014 rad/s
  - ✅ Robot returned to forward movement

======================================================================
ATTACK SUCCESS ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Key Metrics:
  - Angular Velocity Change: +0.422 rad/s (from 0.000 to 0.422)
  - Yaw Change: -130.3° during attack (vs 0.0° before)
  - Lateral Movement: Increased during attack

Success Criteria Assessment:
  ✅ Angular velocity increased significantly (0.422 rad/s)
  ✅ Yaw change increased dramatically (130.3° turn)
  ✅ Robot behavior changed from straight to turning

VERDICT: 🎯 ATTACK SUCCESSFUL

The injection attack successfully overrode the normal controller.
The robot changed from moving straight forward to turning left,
demonstrating that higher frequency publishing can dominate the
/cmd_vel topic in ROS2.

CONCLUSION
======================================================================

This experiment successfully demonstrates:
1. Application layer injection attack on ROS2 /cmd_vel topic
2. Frequency-based override (50 Hz vs 10 Hz)
3. Successful hijacking of robot control
4. Clear behavioral change (straight → turn left)

The attack succeeded because:
- Higher publish frequency (50 Hz) filled message queue faster
- More recent messages from attacker dominated topic
- No authentication or access control in default ROS2

This highlights the security vulnerability of unsecured ROS2 topics.
